## Health Analytics

This repo contains MATLAB and Python/TensorFlow programs applying pattern recognition
and machine learning (ML) techniques to medical problems using relevant open source datasets.

ML techniques include:
- Regression
  + [Linear regression](/Regression%20model%20(Parkinson's%20patients))
  + [Principal component regression](/Principal%20Component%20analysis)
- Classification
  + [Minimum distance and Bayesian classification](/Minimum%20Distance%20and%20Bayesian%20classification%20(Arrythmia%20patients))
  + [Support vector machine (SVM) classification](/SVM%20Classification%20(Arrhythmia%20patients))
- Clustering
  + [Hierarchical clustering](/Hierarchical%20clustering)
  + [K-means clustering](/K-Means%20clustering%20(Arrythmia%20patients))
  + [Image processing by K-means](/Image%20Processing%20of%20Moles)
- Neural networks
  + [NN regression](/Neural%20Network%20regression%20(Parkinson's))
  + [NN classification](/Neural%20Network%20classification%20(Arrythmia))
- [Decision trees](/Hierarchical%20clustering)
- [Hidden Markov model](/Vowel%20Recognition%20(Hidden%20Markov%20Model))

which are applied to:
- Parkinson's disease
- Arrhythmia
- Moles/tumors
- Chronic kidney disease
- Electroencephalogram

Each folder in repo includes its description in README.md and pre-processed dataset along with code files for a specific 
problem i.e. Neuralnet classification of Arrhythmia patients will contain data for
arrhythmia patients and python code files.
