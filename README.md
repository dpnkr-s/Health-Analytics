## Health Analytics

This repo contains MATLAB and Python/TensorFlow programs applying pattern recognition
and machine learning (ML) techniques to medical problems using relevant open source datasets.

ML techniques include:
- Regression
  + Linear regression
  + Principal component regression
- Classification
  + Minimum distance and Bayesian classification
  + Support vector machine (SVM) classification
- Clustering
  + Hierarchical clustering
  + K-means clustering
- Neural networks
  + NN regression
  + NN classification
- Decision trees
- Hidden Markov model

which are applied to:
- Parkinson's disease
- Arrhythmia
- Moles/tumors
- Chronic kidney disease
- Electroencephalogram

Each folder in repo includes pre-processed dataset along with code files for a specific 
problem i.e. Neuralnet classification of Arrhythmia patients will contain data for
arrhythmia patients and python code files.
